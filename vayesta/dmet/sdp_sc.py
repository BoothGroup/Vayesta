    others (eg. MOSEK) could be used if this runs into issues.

    Parameters
    ----------
    nelec: integer
        Number of electrons in the system.
    fock: np.array
        Fock matrix of the full system, in the spatial orbital basis.
    impurity_projectors: list of list of np.array
        For each class of symmetry-equivalent impurities, projection from the full spatial orbital basis to the impurity
        set.
    target_rdms: list of np.array
        Impurity-local one-body density matrices for each class of impurities.
    ovlp: np.array
        Overlap matrix of the AOs, so we can implicitly transform into the PAO basis.
