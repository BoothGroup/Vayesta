Vayesta 1.0.1 (19/10/2022)
==========================

    Additions
    ---------
    - Symmetry operations as contextmanager (see examples ewf/molecules/73 and ewf/molecules/74)
    - Inversion and reflection symmetry
    - Direct contraction of ERI blocks with 2-DM cumulant blocks for RCCSD,
      without building complete cluster 2-DM cumulant.
    - Support for two DMET-cluster projectors in MP2-BNO construction
    - EwDMET (energy-weighted DMET) bath orbitals
    - CISD initial guess for CCSD solver

    Fixes
    -----
    - MPI SCF decorator for molecules with density-fitting
    - Wrong shape bug in UMP2-BNO construction in large systems
    - Wrong shape bug for rotational symmetry for basis sets with
      multiple l>0 shells per PySCF bas index
