Custom Hamiltonians 
==========================

Model Hamiltonians are commonly used for simulating systems of interest both in Quantum Chemistry calculations as well as in Condensed-matter studies. 
Vayesta_ enables the creation of customized Hamiltonians by employing the module 'ref:lattmod' and the functions `ref:Hubbard_1d` and `ref:LatticeMF`
contained within. 

To perform calculations using this feature, the required modules must be imported as shown in the following snippet:

.. literalinclude:: 1d_hubbard.py
