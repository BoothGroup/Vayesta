This is the scaffold of the tutorials. To compile it, one needs only to type the following commands in the outer folder where the make files are.

.. code-block:: console
   [~]$ make clean
   [~]$ make html

The **html** results can be displayed via an internet browser (chrome, firefox, etc), following these lines of code

.. code-block:: console

   [~]$ cd build/html 
   [~]$ firefox index.html
